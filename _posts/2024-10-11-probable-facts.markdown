## Probable Facts

This widget helps you explore how large language models (LLMs), and other systems, decide what counts as a fact.

LLMs do not know what is true in the way people do. They work with probabilities. If something is written down often enough, it becomes more likely to be repeated, even if it is not accurate. This is one way of establishing a “fact”, but it is not the only one.

There are many different knowledge systems that define and validate facts in different ways. This is part of a field called epistemology, the study of how we know what we know. For example:

- Banks rely on ledgers, rules, and audits  
- Religions may rely on scripture, tradition, or spiritual authority  
- Science uses observation, experimentation, and peer review
- Throughtout time, something that is true today may also not be true tomorrow 
- LLMs use statistical patterns in language data  

Each system has its own logic, and each can produce different kinds of “truth”.

## How to Use This Widget

In the left column, write something you believe is a probable fact, something that feels true because it is commonly said or widely repeated.

In the right column, try to reframe that statement using a different way of establishing a fact. You might use scientific reasoning, historical evidence, personal experience, or another knowledge system. In the right column, you say what is acutally true and in what context. 

This is not about proving something right or wrong, it is about seeing how facts can be shaped by the systems that produce them.

### Examples of Probable Facts

| Probable Fact | Alternative Fact |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog | Foxes are not typically brown, they are usually red, grey, or arctic white |
| Goldfish have a three-second memory | Goldfish can remember things for months and can even be trained |
| Humans only use 10 percent of their brains | Brain imaging shows we use virtually every part of the brain, even when at rest |
| Bats are blind | Bats can see quite well, and some species even have excellent night vision |
| Lightning never strikes the same place twice | It often does, tall structures like the Empire State Building are struck many times a year |
| Vikings wore horned helmets | There is no historical evidence for this, it was popularised by nineteenth-century opera costumes |
| You swallow eight spiders a year in your sleep | There is no scientific basis for this, spiders tend to avoid humans |
| Sugar makes kids hyperactive | Multiple studies have shown no consistent link between sugar intake and hyperactivity |
| Shaving makes hair grow back thicker | Shaving does not change the thickness, colour, or rate of hair growth |
| Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis | There is no evidence linking knuckle cracking to arthritis |

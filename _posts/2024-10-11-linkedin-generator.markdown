## LinkedIn Generator

Ever noticed how LinkedIn posts all start to sound the same?

> “Thrilled to announce…”  
> “Humbled to have been part of…”  
> “Grateful for this opportunity…”

It’s not just you. LinkedIn has its own style, tone, and unwritten rules. Just like any other online space really. On LinkedIn people tend to write in a way that fits the platform’s expectations: professional, polished, and often a bit… vague.

This widget lets you explore how generative AI picks up on those patterns.

You’ll start by writing a simple idea, maybe something you learnt, a project you finished, or a thought you had. Then, the model will turn it into a LinkedIn-style post.

You might notice that your original idea gets dressed up in a lot of buzzwords. Or that it suddenly sounds more confident, more polished or more generic.

That’s because LLMs don’t understand meaning. They generate text based on what *sounds* right for a given context. And LinkedIn has a very strong pattern.

#### Try it out:
- Write a short idea or update in your own words.
- See how the model transforms it into a LinkedIn post.
- Try changing your input. Does the tone always shift the same way?

### Questions to Think About:
- How did the tone or message change in the LinkedIn version?
- Did it feel more professional? More vague? More confident?
- What parts of your original idea got lost or exaggerated?

### So What?

This widget shows how LLMs are great at mimicking tone and style, especially in spaces where people write in predictable ways.

That makes them useful for:
- Drafting content that fits a specific platform or audience
- Helping with tone, structure, or phrasing

But it also means:
- They can reinforce clichés or empty language
- They might strip away nuance or personal voice

#### What do you think?
- When is it helpful to sound “LinkedIn-y”? When is it not?
- What does this say about how we communicate online?
- Can AI help us write better or just more of the same?

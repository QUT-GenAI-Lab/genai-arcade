# **Speak My Language**

---

> What if AI could talk to you the way your friends do? Or use the slang from your neighborhood? How would that change the way you interact with it?

Most popular AI tools are trained primarily on English text, and even when they work in other languages, they often reflect the cultural norms and communication styles of English-speaking, Western countries. But language isn't just about words—it carries culture, identity, and ways of thinking.

This widget lets you explore how different cultural contexts and communication styles might change an AI's responses. You can ask it to respond "like someone from [your region/culture]" or 
to use specific cultural communication patterns.

Try the same question with different cultural contexts. Notice how the examples, tone, assumptions, and even the structure of the answer might change.

## **Cultural Communication Patterns**

Different cultures have different ways of communicating. Some are more direct, others more indirect. Some prioritize individual achievement, others emphasize community harmony. Some cultures expect elaborate context before getting to the point, while others value brevity.

When you ask an AI to respond "like someone from Japan," it might give more context, be more indirect, and emphasize group harmony. Ask it to respond "like someone from Germany," and you might get more direct, structured answers. Ask for a "Nigerian" perspective, and you might get more storytelling, proverbs, or community-focused examples.

## **So What?**

This experiment reveals something important: there's no such thing as "neutral" AI. By default, most AI systems reflect the cultural patterns of their training data, which skews heavily toward certain regions and demographics. 

When AI gives you an answer, it's not just providing information—it's presenting that information through a particular cultural lens. Understanding this helps us recognize both the limitations and possibilities of AI communication.

## **What's Missing?**

While this widget can mimic some surface-level cultural communication patterns, it's important to remember that AI doesn't truly understand these cultures. It's pattern-matching based on text it has seen, which might include stereotypes or incomplete representations.

Real cultural competence involves understanding history, values, lived experiences, and nuanced social dynamics that AI can't fully capture. The AI is performing a version of culture, not embodying it.

## **Reflections**

* How did the cultural context change the response style?
* Did you notice different examples, values, or assumptions?
* Which response felt most natural or familiar to you?
* What cultural communication patterns were missing or misrepresented?
* How might this affect people from different cultural backgrounds using AI?
* What are the benefits and risks of AI adapting to different cultural styles?

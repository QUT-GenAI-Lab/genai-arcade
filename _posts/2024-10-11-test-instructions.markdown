## GenAI Arcade: Explore, Play, and Understand AI

This isn’t your average explainer site. Here, you’ll get hands-on with interactive experiences — we call them **widgets** — that let you explore some of the inner workings of generative AI.

Each widget dives into a different part of how AI "thinks."  
Sometimes it’s about how it reasons.  
Other times, it’s about the training data that makes a response possible.  
And sometimes, it’s about the environment that sustains our use of AI.

You don’t need to be a tech expert. You don’t need to know how to code.  
All you need is a bit of curiosity.

Whether you're here to learn something new, challenge what you think you know, or just mess around and see what happens you're in the right place.

## Why Does This Matter?

Generative AI is everywhere: in your feeds, your apps, your music, your memes.  
But most people don’t really know how it works. And that’s a problem.

Big tech companies often explain AI in ways that sound helpful but don’t tell the full story.  
Sometimes, they even make things more confusing on purpose to make their software seem more powerful than it actually is.

That’s why it’s important to build **real experiences** with AI, ones that don’t require a long-winded explanation.

At QUT’s GenAI Lab, we believe the future of generative AI isn’t set in stone.  
We still have the power to shape it but that power depends on understanding how AI works and deciding what kind of AI we want to build.

The choices we make now, about which tools we use and what we use them for, will shape the future of this technology.  
So let’s make those choices informed ones.

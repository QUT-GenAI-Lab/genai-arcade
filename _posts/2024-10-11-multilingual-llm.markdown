## Languages

AI models don’t understand language the way humans do.  
They don’t “translate” ideas between languages, they just look for patterns in the data they’ve seen for each language.

That means when you ask the same question in different languages, the model might give very different answers. Not because it’s trying to be biased, but because it’s pulling from different sources.

And that can get tricky and political.

Just imagine how a topic like Gaza might be discussed in Arabic versus Hebrew.  
The language used, the tone, the framing. All of it can shift depending on the cultural and political context of the language.

But it’s not just about politics.  
Some languages like English are used much more widely online. That means there’s a lot more training data available.  
For smaller or less digitally represented languages, the model might struggle to give good answers or might not work well at all.

In this widget, you can ask the same question in different languages and compare the responses.  
What changes? What stays the same? What does that tell you?

## Reflections:
- Did the model give different answers in different languages?
- Were some responses more detailed or confident than others?
- What might that say about the sources the model is drawing from?
- How does this affect people who don’t speak English or whose languages are underrepresented online?

## So What?

This experiment shows that language isn’t neutral — and neither are the models trained on it.

LLMs reflect the data they’ve seen, and that data is shaped by who writes it, how they write it, and what language they write it in.

That means:
- People who speak dominant languages (like English) get better, more reliable results.
- People who speak less common languages may get weaker, less accurate, or more biased responses.
- The way a topic is discussed can shift dramatically depending on the language used.

## What do you think?
- What are the risks of relying on AI for information in different languages?
- How might this shape whose voices are heard — and whose are left out?
- What could be done to make AI more inclusive across languages?

# Welcome

Feel free to explore this page in your own way; it's designed to be flexible and interactive.  
However, if you're looking for a recommended path, here’s what we suggest:

## Start Here

1. **[About the Arcade and why it matters](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/test-instructions)**  
   Learn how the page is structured and how to get the most out of it.

2. **[Explainer](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20250521/explainer)**  
   Get a very simple overview of Large Language Models from what they are, to how they work, and why they matter.

## Explore the Widgets

Following on, you will find our widgets. These are interactive experiences that let you explore some ideas around LLMs. These GenAI models have a very particular way if *”thinking”* and that means they are good at some things and bad at others. With these experiences you can explore the impact that this way of thinking has. 

- **[Context Window](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/context-window)**
  Discover how much information the model can consider at once and why they are sometimes forgetful. 

- **[Knowledge Cutoff](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/knowledge-cutoff)**
  Understand that models are a snapshot of in time. When it was trained has implications for what the model can and cannot know. 

- **[Politeness](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/politeness)**
  Experiment with how the model not only adjusts tone and phrasing for different levels of politeness but that it also provides answers that may be different if we are chatting in a formal or informal way. 

- **[Multilingual LLM](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/multilingual-llm)** 
  Try out the model’s ability to understand multiple languages and why there is a lot of politics in the way that this happens. 

- **[LinkedIn Generator](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/linkedin-generator)** 
  With this experience, we get to look at something that AI excels at. And that is creating text for a space where all that is being said sounds like of the same anyways. 

- **[Neutral Inputs](https://qut-genai-lab.github.io/genai-arcade/20241011/neutral-inputs)**
  Explore the neutral point of a visual image model and explore what its most dominant visual patterns reveal about the training dataset for an image generator.

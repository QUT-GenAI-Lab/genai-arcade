## GenAI Arcade: Explore, Play, and Understand AI

This isn’t your average explainer site. Whether you're here to learn something new, challenge what you think you know, or just mess around and see what happens, you're in the right place. You don’t need to be a tech expert. You don’t need to know how to code. All you need is a bit of curiosity.

Here, you’ll get hands on with interactive experiences, we call them **widgets**, that let you explore some of the inner workings of generative AI. Each widget dives into a different part of how AI *thinks*: Sometimes they are about how AI reasons, other times, about the training data that makes an AI's response possible, and sometimes about the environment that sustains our use of AI. We have sorted every widget in the GenAI Arcade into one of four categories. They are:
   * **[Knowing](/genai-arcade/tag/knowing/)** - This is about how a model knows, not what it knows, but the way it comes to know anything at all.
   * **[Data](genai-arcade/tag/data/)** - This is about what the model can know, and how that depends entirely on the data it has been trained on.
   * **[Limits](/genai-arcade/tag/limits)** - This is about where the edges are, the boundaries of memory, time, and capability that shape what the model can do.
   * **[Values](/genai-arcade/tag/values/)** - This is about the human choices behind the model, what it’s allowed to say, what it avoids, and who decides.

Each widget focuses on one of these, but none of them exist in isolation. Every time you explore one category, you’re also brushing up against the others.

## Why Does This Matter?

Generative AI is everywhere: in your feeds, your apps, your music, your memes.  
But most people don’t really know how it works. And that’s a problem.

Big tech companies often explain AI in ways that sound helpful but don’t tell the full story.  
Sometimes, they even make things more confusing on purpose to make their software seem more powerful than it actually is. It's part of the sale. 

That’s why it’s important to build *real experiences* with AI, ones that don’t require a long-winded explanation or hide the fact that AI sometimes simply isn't very smart. 

At QUT’s GenAI Lab, we believe the future of generative AI isn’t set in stone.  
We have the power to shape it but that power depends on understanding how AI works and deciding what kind of AI we want to build.

The choices we make now, about which tools we use and what we use them for, will shape the future of this technology.

## Start Here

Feel free to explore this page in your own way; it's designed to be flexible and interactive.  
However, if you're looking for a recommended path, just use the 👉 *button* in the task bar. If you are looking for specific content, here is what we suggest: 
- **[AI Explainer]({/genai-arcade/20250521/explainer)** - Get a very simple overview of Large Language Models from what they are, to how they work, and why they matter.
- **[About the GenAI Lab](/20250520/about-us)** - Learn about us, why we build this tool and how to contact us.

## Explore the Widgets

Following on, you will find our widgets. These are interactive experiences that let you explore some ideas around LLMs. These GenAI models have a very particular way if *thinking* and that means they are good at some things and bad at others. With these experiences you can explore the impact that this way of thinking has. 

**Knowing**
- **[Probable Facts](/20241011/probable-facts)** - This widget helps you explore how large language models (LLMs), and other systems, decide what counts as a fact.
- **[Calculator](/20241011/llm-calculator)** - Explore why generative AI is actually not very good at maths. 
- **[LinkedIn Generator](/20241011/linkedin-generator)** - With this experience, we get to look at something that AI excels at. And that is creating text for a space where all that is being said sounds like of the same anyways.

**Data**
- **[Politeness](/20241011/politeness)** - Experiment with how the model not only adjusts tone and phrasing for different levels of politeness but that it also provides answers that may be different if we are chatting in a formal or informal way.
- **[Multilingual LLM](/20241011/multilingual-llm)** - Try out the model’s ability to understand multiple languages and why there is a lot of politics in the way that this happens.
- **[Neutral Inputs](/20241011/neutral-inputs)** - Explore the neutral point of a visual image model and explore what its most dominant visual patterns reveal about the training dataset for an image generator.
 
**Limits** 
- **[Knowledge Cutoff](/20241011/knowledge-cutoff)** - Understand that models are a snapshot of in time. When it was trained has implications for what the model can and cannot know. 
- **[Context Window](/20241011/context-window)** - Discover how much information the model can consider at once and why they are sometimes forgetful. 

**Values**
- **[Milkless](/20241011/milkless)** - This is a thought-provoking challenge where you explore how language models handle safety restrictions—by trying to get an AI trained not to talk about milk to break its own rules.
